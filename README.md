dns-sd-proxy-service
====================

Creates DNS-SD proxies for reachable services

Dirty shell script experimenting with using `nmap` to check for service availability on an arbritrary port.  If the service is available it is registered as a proxy with DNS-SD.

`launchable example.command` is an example showing how the `spawn_dns-sd.sh` script can be called to monitor and register multiple services.

Use at your own risk.
